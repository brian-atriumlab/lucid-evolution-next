# Lucid Evolution Demo with Next.js

This is a **quick and lightweight demo project** showcasing the integration of the [Lucid Evolution](https://github.com/AnastasiaLabs/lucid-evolution) library with a Next.js TypeScript application. It's designed to help you get started with using Lucid Evolution in your own projects, connecting a Cardano wallet, and interacting with the blockchain through Blockfrost.

## About This Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and test the `@lucid-evolution/lucid` npm package within a Next.js environment. It's a basic proof of concept that allows you to initialize Lucid with Blockfrost as a provider and connect a browser wallet like Eternl.

Feel free to modify the Blockfrost configuration to test different scenarios and explore the capabilities of Lucid Evolution.

## Connect Your Wallet

Click the "Connect Wallet" button to start Lucid with Blockfrost as the provider. You can edit the Blockfrost configuration in the code to test different setups.
